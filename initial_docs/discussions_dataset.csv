## Overview

This is an interactive responsive dynamic website for my portfolio made with django, where the data is retrieved from the database. The idea of using django is that it would be beneficial when creating a Blog app later, or any related apps.

- Hosted on Render

### Technologies Used

- Django Framework
- Python


### Problems Faced:

- I had lots of issues with the deployment, First I used Azure but during deployment the requirements.txt file wasn't visible which caused a faliure in the deployment. I also tried to use PythonAnywhere, but I ran into some errors too. Then some friend suggested I can use Render as its easy for simple Django apps, which was true.

### What I learnt

- I learnt new things in Django like dealing with static files and media files
- Learned dealing with python virtual environments
- Got a good experience with the deployment process

## Rough Neighborhood

Egypt is located in a rough neighborhood. Just take a look at this map. There are so many conflicts and suffering within this region of the world. Egypt's relative stability makes it a safe haven for a lot of people looking for safety.

## The Problem

- The capacity for Government, NGOs and INGOs to handle sudden emergency are limited in so many ways. Citizens can react so much faster. It's just coordinating the effort and figuring out the demands/actual needs are almost impossible for an average person to do.
- The situation is not going to get better anytime soon - especially with the impact of climate change start to accelerate and igniting conflicts over basic resources such as food and water.  

## The Plan

We need to prepare for the next crisis, which will eventually come. For that, we need to prepare a set of services that are ready when the eventualities arise and also be useful to contribute in easing the hardship of people affected by the current crises.  

The services need to be dual use because that's the only way the information and systems get maintained and sustained. It also help average people to be familiar with the systems and services because they use it occasionally in their daily life. This reduces the requirement to have specialists to coordinate and lead ad-hoc support teams.

## End note

The scale of the problem is enormous and this project is going to be difficult to execute to fulfill its ambitions and goals. But we need to start somewhere, so let's start.","The Situation
